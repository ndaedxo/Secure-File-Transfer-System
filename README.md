# Secure File Transfer System

A secure file transfer application that allows users to upload and download files with end-to-end encryption, providing a safe way to share files.

## Features

- **File Upload with Encryption:** Upload files to the server, where they are encrypted using a password-based encryption scheme.
- **File Download with Decryption:** Download files that are securely decrypted upon retrieval.
- **User Authentication:** Protect files with user authentication to ensure only authorized users can upload or download files.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitor file upload progress while files are being transferred.
- **File History:** View past upload and download activities.

## Technologies Used

- **Django:** Web framework for building the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used to style the user interface.
- **Alpine.js:** A minimal framework for adding interactivity to the frontend.
- **Python:** Backend language to handle business logic, file encryption, and decryption.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or higher
- Tailwind CSS
- Alpine.js
- A database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Secure-File-Transfer-System.git
cd Secure-File-Transfer-System
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure `requirements.txt` includes the necessary dependencies:

```txt
Django>=3.0,<4.0
cryptography
```

### 3. Configure the Database

Run the Django migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Set Up Static Files

For Tailwind CSS and other static assets, run:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 5. Create a Superuser

To access the Django admin panel and manage users:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

You can start the Django development server using:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to use the application.

## User Authentication

Users need to sign up and log in to upload or download files. You can register as a new user via the signup page and log in through the login page.

### Login URL

`/login/` - Login page for authenticated users.

### Signup URL

`/signup/` - Register a new user.

### File Transfer URLs

- **/dashboard/**: User dashboard, shows file upload/download history.
- **/upload/**: Upload a file and encrypt it for transfer.
- **/download/{file_id}/**: Download a file and decrypt it for access.

## File Encryption

Files uploaded to the platform are encrypted using a userâ€™s username as the encryption key. You can customize the encryption scheme as needed.
